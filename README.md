python for beginners
Hello world 
We use print to execute he word (Hello world) on the interpreter
Eg print (“hello world:”)
We have date types the  you have to know as a python programmer such as string which refers to text, integer which refers to number Boolean true or false ,and then float which deals with decimals
Eg name = “edmond”
Print(name)
The word edmond will be printed.
STRINGS FORMATTING
We have two way we can format the string 
Eg name = “edmond”
Print (“Everyday “+ name+ “wakes up to do programming”)
Now this is the old version of the formatting the string it will work when you change the name edmond and use the other name it will go through
But we have another way for doing it which is simple 
Eg Print (f “Everyday “{name} “wakes up to do programming”)
Now this is what we call the F formatting using the f to format the string is very easy to use in formatting and save time

Input functions
Num_a = input(“enter first number”)
Num_b = input(“enter second number”)
Converting the string to number
Num_a = int(num_a)
Num_b = int(num_b)
Total the sum of num_a and num_ b is 
Total = num_a +num_b
Print(total)
